This package allows you to run [Browsershot](https://github.com/spatie/browsershot) on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) through [Sidecar](https://github.com/hammerstonedev/sidecar).

You won't need to install Node, Puppeteer or Google Chrome on your server. The heavy lifting of booting a headless Google Chrome instance is happening on AWS Lambda.

## Requirements

This package requires that [`spatie/browsershot`](https://github.com/spatie/browsershot) and [`hammerstone/sidecar`](https://github.com/hammerstonedev/sidecar) have been installed in your Laravel application.

Follow their installation and configuration instructions. (You can skip the installation of puppeteer and Google Chrome for Browsershot though.)

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require wnx/sidecar-browsershot
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="sidecar-browsershot-config"
```

Register the `BrowsershotFunction::class` in your `sidecar.php` config file.

```php
/*
 * All of your function classes that you'd like to deploy go here.
 */
'functions' => [
    \Wnx\SidecarBrowsershot\Functions\BrowsershotFunction::class,
],
```

Deploy the Lambda function by running:

```shell
php artisan sidecar:deploy --activate
```

See [Sidecar documentation](https://hammerstone.dev/sidecar/docs/main/functions/deploying) for details.

## Usage

You can use `BrowsershotLambda` like the default `Browsershot`-class coming from the Spatie package.
All you need to do is replace `Browsershot` with `BrowsershotLambda`.

```php
use Wnx\SidecarBrowsershot\BrowsershotLambda;

// an image will be saved
BrowsershotLambda::url('https://example.com')->save($pathToImage);

// a pdf will be saved
BrowsershotLambda::url('https://example.com')->save('example.pdf');

// save your own HTML to a PDF
BrowsershotLambda::html('<h1>Hello world!!</h1>')->save('example.pdf');

// Get HTML of a URL and store it on a given disk
$html = BrowsershotLambda::url('https://example.com')->bodyHtml();
Storage::disk('s3')->put('example.html', $html);
```

## Warming

sidecar-browsershot supports [warming](https://hammerstone.dev/sidecar/docs/main/functions/warming) for faster execution.

To enable this feature set the `SIDECAR_BROWSERSHOT_WARMING_INSTANCES` variable in your `.env` to the desired number of instances Sidecar should warm for you.

```shell
SIDECAR_BROWSERSHOT_WARMING_INSTANCES=5
```

Alternatively you can publish the `sidecar-browsershot.php` config file and change the `warming` setting yourself.

## Reading source from S3

You can store an HTML file on AWS S3 and pass the path to Lambda for it to create the PDF or image from. 
This is necessary for large source files in order to avoid restrictions on the size of Lambda requests.

```php
use Wnx\SidecarBrowsershot\BrowsershotLambda;

// Use an HTML file from S3 to generate a PDF
BrowsershotLambda::readHtmlFromS3('html/example.html')->save('example.pdf');

// You can also pass a disk name if required (default: 's3')
BrowsershotLambda::readHtmlFromS3('html/example.html', 's3files')->save('example.pdf');
```

## Saving directly to S3

You can store your file directly on AWS S3 if you want to keep it there, or to avoid the size limit on Lambda responses.

You just need to pass a path and optional disk name (default: 's3') to the `saveToS3` method.
- You must have an S3 disk defined in config/filesystems.php
- You must give S3 write permissions to your sidecar-execution-role

```php
use Wnx\SidecarBrowsershot\BrowsershotLambda;

// an image will be saved on S3
BrowsershotLambda::url('https://example.com')->saveToS3('example.jpg');

// a pdf will be saved on S3
BrowsershotLambda::url('https://example.com')->saveToS3('example.pdf');

// save your own html to a PDF on S3
BrowsershotLambda::html('<h1>Hello world!!</h1>')->saveToS3('example.pdf', 'example-store');
```

## Image Manipulation
Like the original Browsershot package, you can [manipulate the image](https://spatie.be/docs/browsershot/v2/usage/creating-images#content-sizing-the-image) size and format.

> **Note**   
> If you're using `fit()` in combination with `saveToS3`, the image will be downloaded from S3 to your local disc, manipulated and then uploaded back to S3.

```php
// Take screenshot at 1920x1080 and scale it down to fit 200x200 
BrowsershotLambda::url('https://example.com')
    ->windowSize(1920, 1080)
    ->fit(Manipulations::FIT_CONTAIN, 200, 200)
    ->save('example.jpg');
    
// Take screenshot at 1920x1080 and scale it down to fit 200x200 and save it on S3
// Note: To do the image manipulation, BrowsershotLambda will download the image
// from S3 to the local disc of your app, manipulate it and then upload it back to S3. 
BrowsershotLambda::url('https://example.com')
    ->windowSize(1920, 1080)
    ->fit(Manipulations::FIT_CONTAIN, 200, 200)
    ->saveToS3('example.jpg');
```

## Register Custom Fonts

By default, sidecar-browsershot includes the "Noto Color Emoji"-font, to ensure that emojis are rendered correctly.
If you want to use custom fonts, you can put them all into a `resources/sidecar-browsershot/fonts`-folder. (You can customize the location of that folder in the `sidecar-browsershot.fonts` config)

sidecar-browsershot will include all files in that folder when deploying the Lambda function and will register them automatically in Chromium for you.

## Testing

The testsuite makes connections to AWS and runs the deployed Lambda function. In order to run the testsuite, you will need an active [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/).

We can use the native `sidecar:configure` artisan command to create the necessary AWS credentials for Sidecar. First copy the `testbench.example.yaml` file to `testbench.yaml`.
Then run `./vendor/bin/testbench sidecar:configure` to start the Sidecar setup process. (You only have to do the setup once)

```bash
cp testbench.example.yaml testbench.yaml
cp .env.example .env
./vendor/bin/testbench sidecar:configure
```

After finishing the Sidecar setup process, you will have received a couple of `SIDECAR_*` environment variables. Add these credentials to `.env`.

Now we can deploy our local `BrowsershotFunction` to AWS Lambda. Run the following command in your terminal, before executing the testsuite.

```bash
./vendor/bin/testbench sidecar-browsershot:setup
```

After the successful deployment, you can run the testsuite.

```bash
composer test
```
