This package allows you to run [Browsershot](https://github.com/spatie/browsershot) on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) through [Sidecar](https://github.com/hammerstonedev/sidecar).

You won't need to install Node, Puppeteer or Google Chrome on your server. The heavy lifting of booting a headless Google Chrome instance is happening on AWS Lambda.

## Requirements

This package requires that [`spatie/browsershot`](https://github.com/spatie/browsershot) and [`hammerstone/sidecar`](https://github.com/hammerstonedev/sidecar) have been installed in your Laravel application.

Follow their installation and configuration instructions. (You can skip the installation of puppeteer and Google Chrome for Browsershot though.)

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require wnx/sidecar-browsershot
```

Register the `BrowsershotFunction::class` in your `sidecar.php` config file.

```php
/*
 * All of your function classes that you'd like to deploy go here.
 */
'functions' => [
    \Wnx\SidecarBrowsershot\Functions\BrowsershotFunction::class,
],
```

Deploy the Lambda function by running:

```shell
php artisan sidecar:deploy --activate
```

See [Sidecar documentation](https://hammerstone.dev/sidecar/docs/main/functions/deploying) for details.

## Usage

You can use `BrowsershotLambda` like the default `Browsershot`-class coming from the Spatie package.
All you need to do is replace `Browsershot` with `BrowsershotLambda`.

```php
use Wnx\SidecarBrowsershot\BrowsershotLambda;

// an image will be saved
BrowsershotLambda::url('https://example.com')->save($pathToImage);

// a pdf will be saved
BrowsershotLambda::url('https://example.com')->save('example.pdf');

// save your own HTML to a PDF
BrowsershotLambda::html('<h1>Hello world!!</h1>')->save('example.pdf');

// Get HTML of a URL and store it on a given disk
$html = BrowsershotLambda::url('https://example.com')->bodyHtml();
Storage::disk('s3')->put('example.html', $html);
```

## Testing

The testsuite makes connections to AWS and runs the deployed Lambda function. In order to run the testsuite, you will need an active [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/).

We can use the native `sidecar:configure` artisan command to create the necessary AWS credentials for Sidecar. First copy the `testbench.example.yaml` file to `testbench.yaml`.
Then run `./vendor/bin/testbench sidecar:configure` to start the Sidecar setup process. (You only have to do the setup once)

```bash
cp testbench.example.yaml testbench.yaml
cp .env.example .env
./vendor/bin/testbench sidecar:configure
```

After finishing the Sidecar setup process, you will have received a couple of `SIDECAR_*` environment variables. Add these credentials to `testbench.yaml` and `.env`.

Now we can deploy our local `BrowsershotFunction` to AWS Lambda. Run the following command in your terminal, before executing the testsuite.

```bash
./vendor/bin/testbench sidecar-browsershot:setup
```

After the successful deployment, you can run the testsuite.

```bash
composer test
```
